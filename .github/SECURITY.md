# Security

<br>

Security reports should be handled privately.

<br>

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. Use [`GitHub Security Advisories`](https://github.com/bniladridas/vesper/security/advisories/new) instead.

<br>

If that is not available, contact the maintainer through GitHub with enough context to start triage.

<br>

# Supported Versions

<br>

Security fixes target the latest released version and the current `main` branch. Older releases may receive fixes when the change is small and the affected version is still practical to patch.

<br>

# Reports

<br>

A useful report explains the affected version, environment, impact, and reproduction steps. A small proof of concept is helpful when it is safe to share privately.

<br>

Please include any known workaround if one exists. If you have a suggested fix, include it as context, but do not open a public pull request before the issue is triaged.

<br>

# Handling

<br>

Reports are reviewed privately. The fix is prepared, tested, and released before public disclosure when disclosure is needed.

<br>

Security updates are released as patch versions when possible. Users should run the latest patch version available for their chosen release line.

<br>

# Project Practices

<br>

API keys should stay in environment variables or a secret manager. The project masks keys in logs, avoids committing local config, and uses dependency and secret scanning in CI.

<br>

Use `bundle audit` when dependencies change:

<br>

```bash
bundle exec bundle-audit
```
